      <div class="profile_info">
        <p>
          My interest in coding spawned from a frustration of wanting apps that just didn't exist, where I eventually got to the point of saying... well I'll just learn how to create them myself then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always had a high aptitude for and got a lot of enjoyment from problem-solving&#59; things like Sudoku. And when I started learning to code I was instantly hooked. It was almost like a drug to have a vision of something that I wanted to create, and then to have to figure-out how to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly realised that my previous career of teaching, although still rewarding in other ways, had stagnated in the challenge it could provide me, which was why I decided to expand coding from being a free-time hobby, to a full-time passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find something that you love, then you'll never work another day in your life, which is what drove me to doing a bootcamp. It was the quickest route that I could take to turn this passion and natural proficiency into skills that would be useful to an employer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I'm looking for a project that I'm passionate about, to which I can dedicate myself as I continue to grow, and that allows me to be expressive through coding.
